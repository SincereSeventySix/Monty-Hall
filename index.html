After their guess, the user is shown what's behind one of the doors and has the option to either <strong>stay</strong> with their choice or <strong>switch</strong> their initial choice. This program runs the test as many times as you want to decipher wheather <strong>staying</strong> or <switch>switching</switch> is a better strategy for winning the prize. </h3>
